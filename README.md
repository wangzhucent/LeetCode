# Problem 1: Two sum, hashtable
# Problem 2: Add two linked list, lined list, mind the carry digit
# Problem 3: Longest Substring Without Repearting Charasters, slide window
# Problem 4: Median of Two Sorted Arrays, binary search
Binary search takes care of the termination condition: while(left<right)
If division prefers left, like mid = (left+right)/2, then, left should be < and mid+1 and it gives the left boundary
If the division preferes right, like mid = (left+right+1)/2, then, right should be > and mid-1 and this gives the right boundary
# Problem 5: Longest Palindromic, Palindromic string should be checked from middle.
!!! Manacher's algorithm can achieve O(n)
# Problem 6: 

Useful string, character, integer function:
to_string() integer to string
atoi() character to interger
atoll() character to long long
istringstream iss; iss.
